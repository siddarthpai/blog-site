So, I was bored in office and sat and upgraded this site lmao.
Got it to support Videos, images and code blocks.
SO NOW THAT IT SUPPORTS VIDEOS AND IMAGES, COLDPLAYYYY TIMEEEEEE

I shit you not, one of the wildest adventures one can imagine 😭

So we started off from blr and took a flight to mumbai and it was supposed to land at 1:30 but mumbai's air traffic is usually bad, it got delayed by about 30 mins so we landed only at around 2.

Which honestly is super fine considering our train from mumbai to ahmedabad\
\*\*_INSERT DRUMROLLS_\*\*
🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁\
IS\
NOT SHATABDI EXPRESS or VANDE BHARAT\
ITS the **ALMIGHTY GUJRAT SF EXPRESS** (Tickets were 170 rupees 😭)\
and before you shit on us, it is literally always on time, so we decided to trust[mistake #1]\
\
Anyways, before we boarded only they told us it was delayed by an hour 💀 so the train was scheduled to leave at 6:40 instead of 5:40 which meant we'd reach at like 3:30[mind you, gates close at 7:30 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣]

So, we decided to explore Mumbai and omg, I honestly fell in love.\
**WHAT A CITY**\
The skylines and the seas and the bridges, it was like a dream come true _[I've always wanted to see mumbai]_.\
We stopped by at marine drive and had literally some of the best street food ive tasted and proceeded to our beautiful _Mumbai Central_ to board the train.

We find the train and I kid you not, when we entered it was PITCH BLACK. We sat in absolute darkness for 25ish minutes and then finally we got some light xD.\

The train left at about 7:30 and that basically means we reach now at like 4:30 💀 [more and more delay 😋]

The train ride was not for the weak hearted\
People kept boarding with **SACKS OF VEGETABLES, BAGS OF SWEETS and RANDOM PEOPLE CAME TO SING?!??!** (i dont even think he wanted the money)\
but it was fun sitting and seeing all these different experiences.

Now, in the start, we all just majorly slept cause we didn't get much rest from the plane ride and the mumbai sightseeing
WELLLL, not all of us **(I cannot sleep in moving objects 😭😭😭😭😭😭)**\
so here are some nice videos of the train ride.

After a ton of sitting down, we noticed that the train was actually stopping a little too much ?? [every 10 mins or so] and was honestly very confused.\
We get down and talk to the locals there and they just casually dropped a\
`यह ट्रेन पहले से ही लेट है, इसलिए वे ट्रेनों को समय पर जाने दे रहे हैं`\
which briefly translates to\
`this train is already late so fuck the people on this train, we shall keep the other trains on time 🥰`\
and then our train is just standing there\
GUESS FOR WHAT\
**IT'S LETTING THE CARS AT THE RAILWAY CROSSING CROSS.**\
THIS WAS LITERALLY THE FIRST TIME I SAW A TRAIN STOP FOR THE CARS AND NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND ?!?!??!?!?

this was when we realised, if we stayed on this train, we would definitely miss this concert 😭😭😭😭😭😭\
_[I saw a full ass grown man balling his eyes out cause he realised the train ain't gonna make it 😭]_

So, we sat and called all the local cab agencies and started asking for cabs from Vadodra to Ahmedabad[2hr drive].\
We finally got cabs, started changing[YES ON THE TRAIN 😂] and finally reached Vadodra.\
We grabbed lunch and rushed to the cabs and I, in my beautifully broke hindi ✨ tried asking the driver to speed up and send it

Man hits me with the\
`The cab is speed limited to 80 😭😭😭😭`\
and we had to sit and deal with him going at 80 when it's almost 4:30 on a NATIONAL HIGHWAY that was **empty.**\
\
But yeah, we were actually covering good distance and he decided to stop. I thought it was nature's call\
BUT NO, EVEN THOUGH I TOLD HIM ITS A HURRY, MAN STOPPED TO BUY **CHAKLI**\
YES\
**CHAKLI 😭😭😭😭😭😭**

Anyways, we are going fast fast and we managed to reach by 6. We ran up the stairs to our [1 star] hotel ✨ and threw our bags and ran back out headed for the stadium.\
The metros were packed **BUT**\
they'd **take us straight to the stadium**\
**OR**\
we could take a cab through the traffic with no congestion, **BUT**\
we'd have to **cover 1.5 kms on foot** cause it can't drop us to the enterance.\
It's pretty clear what we did.\
_right?_\
**RIGHT?**\
**YEP, WE REACHED AT 6:50 AND RAN A KILOMETER TO THE GATES xD**\

we made it there by 7, but there was no crowd and we entered\
**ENTERED INTO ANOTHER DIMENSION 🥳🥳🥳🥳**\
