Well, this is something I decided to do out of impulse.\
Let's see how far I can take this :))

## **A little about me 🥳:**

• I'm a 21 year old CS grad from blr,india.\
• I'm currently an SDE Intern for 6 months and this is pretty exciting!\
• I'll basically be working in the cloud domain and will be working will large distributed clusters _[Big Data + Cloud]_ \
• I'll be learning a bunch of cool stuff over the next 6 months and imma dump all the info here [I have to generate weekly reports, might as well make it fun hehe].\
 \
• Here's some of the stuff I plan on covering 🤞🏻🤞🏻:

**1. Go Lang** => A language I'm learning on the go(pun intended) and I'll be posting all the resources and notes I make. Y'all can learn with me :)\
**2. Python** => A language I've used before and am comfortable with, but I'll have to use it on a much larger scale now. Any new finding's and learnings will be dropped here.\
**3. Multiple cool new dbs** => The company uses tons of db's and I hope to use and learn how to operate with all of them.\
**4. Terminal and Linux** => Will have to learn how to use the terminal more efficiently _[will finally master vim?]_ and Linux commands. Hoping to make a useful cheatsheet\
**5. Books and Courses** => Will be going through some books to become a better dev and have to do some courses like the _[The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)_ [highly recommended]. Been learning alot through this.

And ofcourse any cool side projects [this blog site was a good start ngl. got it to render raw .md files to html from scratch] and non technical stuff I get to experience will be put here as a part of the journey!
