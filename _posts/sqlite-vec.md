Vector DB's are something I'll be using soon and while going through them I was reminded of a lecture given by Alex Garcia at Bengaluru System Meetup and it was truly an amazing talk. Before we get started lets have a breif intro with what Vector Databases are ðŸ˜‹

## Vector Databases :

As the name suggests...\
They store and query _a lot_ of vectors.

But first, What is a Vector? ðŸ¤”

â€¢Vector : A vector is basically a list of numbers\
\
â€¢Embeddings : Embeddings are basically a representation of text, images, audio etc in the form of a vector\
\
Nowww, these embeddings actually let you perform calculations on these texts.
How?\
Consider these text exampeles

```
Book A: "A beginner's guide to baking bread and pastries"
Book B: "Complete cookbook for making cakes and cookies"
Book C: "Advanced quantum physics and string theory"
```

These get converted to embeddings that looks something like this :

```
Book A: [0.8, 0.9, 0.7, 0.1, ...]  # high values for cooking/baking related dimensions
Book B: [0.7, 0.8, 0.6, 0.2, ...]  # similar pattern because it's also about baking
Book C: [0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.9, ...]  # completely different pattern (science related)
```

Now using these vectors, we can perform multiple operations like finding related documents, finding groups/clusters or even answering questions :))\
\
**COOL RIGHT?????**

### Now, how do they actually store these ?

Consider **A single** 1024 dimension vector
The size required for this 1024 dimension vector is :\
`1024 * sizeof(float) = 1024 * 4 = 4096 bytes ~ 4KB`

Now, if we were to store 1 million of them, that'd be about 4.1 GB's!

While storing 1 million 1024-dimensional vectors takes ~4.1GB, a traditional full-text search index for similar searchable content would require dozens of megabytes just to index text data.\
**This realllyyy shows how vector storage can be more space-efficient for certain types of data retrieval**

### And, what about the querying part??

Something he covered the most during the lecture was\
_KNN Queries_

## What are KNN Queries ?

An example that made me understand this was :
Let's say we have a restaurant recommendation system:

Now, if we were using a vector DB, the original restaurant descriptions of the foods like\
`Quick burger joint with drive-through`
are converted into embeddings like:\
`restaurant1_vector = [0.2, 0.8, 0.5, ...]  # 1024 dimensions`

and now, when the user searches for something like
**"Fast food restaurants for burgers"**\
The query is:\
1.First converted into a vector\
2.KNN then finds the closest vectors by distance using something like **cosine similarity**\
3.and returns the closest, second closest values and so on ...

## What is sqlite-vec?

Now that we've understood all of this.\
sqlite-vec is a sqlite extension for **vector search**âœ¨

â€¢It works inside any custom functions and virtual tables\
â€¢It also works inside an sqlite instance.

**ðŸ’¡Note :** It actually stores your vectors inside your sqlite database ! so all your backup/restore and streaming replication services actually work with sqlite-vec because all the vectors they produce are eventually stored in the DB.\

_btw, sqlite-vec doesn't generate embeddings for you but there are multiple services out there that'll do it for you. feel free to try them_

## Why sqlite-vec?

â€¢**PURE** SQL API\
â€¢runs everywhere\
â€¢has different compression techniques to reduce the size of a vector index [tradeoff of quality for speed and size ].\
\
1.One example of this is **Binary Quantization :** where if the value is >0.0 store as 1 else 0. This basically stores a 32-bit floating vector as a bit vector[THATS A 32X SIZE REDUCTION!!! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³].\
It uses hamming distance instead of cosine distance btw\
\
2.Another one is **Scalar Quantization :** where you basically scale a 32-bit floating point into a int8, int16, float16, etc but for now sqlite-vec supports only int8 so thats a (4x SIZE REDUCTION!! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³)\

## What did I learn from this ?

1.How cool sqlite actually is => I'm gonna give sqllite-vec a shot and you can too btw [<u>here</u>](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec)\
2.He spoke about how cool sqlite extensions are and what they can and can't do. He listed a few cool extensions as well. Imma try them out\
â€¢sqlite-http\
â€¢sqlite-html\
â€¢sqlite-lines\
â€¢sqlite-path\
â€¢sqlite-url\
3.Try out vector dbs and benchmark them and try building something on these
